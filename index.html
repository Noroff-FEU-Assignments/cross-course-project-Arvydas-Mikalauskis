      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      Keep the updates up to date, if the site's software or app are not up to
      date, the site is not secure. Add HTTPS and SSL certificate. Use a unique
      password with authorization protocol. Avoid phishing emails and scams. Use
      a secure web host. Make a website backup, in case some major security
      incident occurs. Tighten security network, have computer logins expire
      after a short period of inactivity, make notification for users to change
      password every three months. Install web application firewall.
